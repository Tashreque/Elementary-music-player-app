# Elementary-music-player-app
This is a simple music player developed in Swift and UIKit using Apple's AVFoundation and MediaPlayer libraries.
This app lets the user play a selection of locally stored songs using media functionalities of the UI. The main focus was to illustrate the use of AVFoundation
and MediaPlayer and as a result, all the functionalities/UI were not implemented yet. There was a plan of integrating dropbox with this app just for
the sake of demonstration but not much apart from authentication and session token handling was done.
